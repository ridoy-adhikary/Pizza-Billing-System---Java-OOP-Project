# Pizza Billing System - Java OOP Project

This is a simple Java console application that demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding. The project simulates a pizza ordering system with customizable options like extra cheese, extra toppings, and takeaway packaging.

---

## Features

- Create vegetarian or non-vegetarian pizzas
- Add extra cheese and toppings (optional)
- Opt for takeaway packaging
- Automatically calculate and display the final bill
- Deluxe pizza subclass with fixed extra cheese and toppings (no extra additions allowed)

---

## Project Structure

- **Main.java** — The entry point with sample pizza orders and billing
- **Pizza.java** — Base class representing a pizza with customizable options
- **DeluxPizza.java** — Subclass of Pizza with predefined extras (extra cheese & toppings)

---

## Code Overview

### Pizza Class
- Fields: price, veg (vegetarian flag), extra prices, flags for extra additions
- Methods:
  - `addExtraCheese()` — Adds cheese and updates price
  - `addExtraToppings()` — Adds toppings and updates price
  - `takeAway()` — Adds takeaway packaging cost
  - `getBill()` — Prints detailed bill including extras and total price
- Constructor sets base price based on veg/non-veg choice

### DeluxPizza Class
- Inherits from `Pizza`
- Automatically adds extra cheese and toppings in constructor
- Overrides `addExtraCheese()` and `addExtraToppings()` methods to prevent further additions
